# Resources

## Welcome! This is a repository comprised of helpful resources about Data Science, Machine Learning, R, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and more!

Everyone has a different learning process and set of resources they find helpful. I want this repo to be accessible to the broader community and cognizant of different learning styles. You can help contribute to this vision by contributing learning tools that you've found helpful.
